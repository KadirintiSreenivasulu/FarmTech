	<h1>Agri Farming Home Page</h1>
		<p>
		Agriculture describes the practice of growing crops or raising animals. Someone who works as a farmer is in the agriculture industry.
		Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry for food and non-food products.[1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the twentieth century, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output.

		<p>
		Today, small farms produce about a third of the world's food, but large farms are prevalent.
		The largest one percent of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares and operate more than 70 percent of the world's farmland.
		Nearly 40 percent of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares.
		However, five of every six farms in the world consist of less than two hectares and take up only around 12 percent of all agricultural land.
		Farms and farming greatly influence rural economics and greatly shape rural society, effecting both the direct agricultural workforce and broader 
		businesses that support the farms and farming populations.
		</p>
		<p>
		The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber). 
		Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, cooking oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi. Global agricultural production amounts 
		to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food, 32 million tonnes of natural fibres and 4 billion m3 of wood.
		However, around 14 percent of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level.
		</p>
		<p>
		Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but also contributed to ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to climate change, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and other agricultural pollution. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation, and climate change, all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some countries ban them.

		<h3>Etymology and scope</h3>
		<p>
		The word agriculture is a late Middle English adaptation of Latin agricultūra, from ager 'field' and cultūra 'cultivation' or 'growing'.
		While agriculture usually refers to human activities, certain species of ant,
		termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to 60 million years.
		Agriculture is defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to "produce commodities which maintain life, 
		including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services".
		Thus defined, it includes arable farming, horticulture, animal husbandry and forestry, but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded.
		It may also be broadly decomposed into plant agriculture, which concerns the cultivation of useful plants,
		 and animal agriculture, the production of agricultural animals.
		</p>
		<h3>Revolution</h3>
		<p>
		In the Middle Ages, compared to the Roman period, agriculture in Western Europe became more focused on self-sufficiency. The agricultural population under feudalism was typically organized into manors consisting of several hundred or more acres of land presided over by a lord of the manor with a Roman Catholic church and priest.
		</p>
		<p>
		Thanks to the exchange with the Al-Andalus where the Arab Agricultural Revolution was underway, European agriculture transformed, with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees (such as the orange)
		</p>
		<p>
		Irrigation, crop rotation, and fertilizers advanced from the 17th century with the British Agricultural Revolution, allowing global population to rise significantly. Since 1900, agriculture in developed nations, and to a lesser extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as mechanization replaces human labor, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining a further increase in global population
